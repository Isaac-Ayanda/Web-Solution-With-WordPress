# Web Solution With WordPress

In this project, I setup a Three-Tier architecture comprising of a client, a linux Redhat webserver where I installed WordPress and another linux Redhat database server where I installed the database.
- `I worked with some storage and disk management utlities that ensures that the disks used to store files on the Linux servers are adequately partitioned and managed.`
- `I prepared storage infrastructure for the web and database servers on Redhat Linux os  and implemented a web solution using WordPress and MySQL Database Management System.`
